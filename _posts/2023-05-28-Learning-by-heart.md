As you're going to start your journey in data science and machine learning lot of things will come your way that might be familiar with you or totally alien. this time few thing get in way of learning where test of memory , patients and passion get tested.

Learning language like python , R are not making life easier for new learners but there things like dashboard making fun with SQL will keep us for challenged in different model building in ML and deep Learning.



Final thoughts
So this post has nothing to do with AL , ML or data science it s all abou challanges you going to face while in carrier change or in upskilling your life. things to remember here is you are completing this journey with your heart in right place than other things will fall in line.
